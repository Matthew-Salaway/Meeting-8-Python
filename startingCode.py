# There will be a school wide coding competition on December 9, 2020!
# It will be held via zoom, and will be in random groups of 3 or 4
# The first team to complete 3 challenges will be the winner (30 minutes total)
# The winning team members will each receive $10 gift cards

# We will be doing a short review over python to prepare for the competition
# Today we will do a quick review and next meeting we will finish reviewing
# The week of the coding competition, we will skip the club meeting and go to the competition
# The week after that will be finals week so no meetings after that, until after break.
# For the second semester we will be diving into data science!

# But now for the review

# Print "Hello World" to the terminal



# Create a variable of each type - Types: String, Int, Double, Boolean






# Print the variable



# Here are 2 vaiables; Print out "[name] is [age] years old!"
name = "Jimmy"
age = 12         # *** Dont forget to convert the int into a string ***


# Jimmy is now 8 years older. Update the age variable by adding 8, making the computer calculate



# Grace is 1.5 times older than Jimmy. Create the "grace" variable by mulipling jimmy's age by 1.5



# We want to know Jimmy's first initial. Create the firstInitial varaible, and assign it Jimmy's first letter
# by referencing the name variable and using [index] to select the first letter.



# We want to know the users age. Create the variable "userAge"
# And assign it to the value the user inputs with the input() function



# Grace and Jimmy are coworkers and want to get a drink after work. The waiter needs to make sure they
# are over 21. Grace looks old enough, but the waiter is unsure about Jimmy

# Create an if/else statement using the age variable to see if the age is 21 or over
# If the age is 21 or over, print "You look young for your age"
# If the age is under 21, print "Nice try Jimmy"
